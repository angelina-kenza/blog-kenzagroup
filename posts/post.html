            <p>I recently decided to attend a 48-hour hackathon organised by <a href=”https://t.co/ytyA6c8Wsy”>Founders of the Future</a>. Straight away I received some interesting comments from friends who wanted to understand more. These included questions such as “I didn’t know you’re a hacker?!”. I have to admit stringing them on that one was enjoyable.<p>


            <p>Firstly, let’s dispel some myths; hackathons are not for just for geeks who code or wannabe hackers. Anyone can attend a hackathon, not just software developers. Non-technical skills are just as useful.<p>

            <p>Two things are key to enjoying a hackathon in my opinion. Stay <b>open-minded</b> and have a willingness to learn. If you don't have that, then at least make sure you can bounce a ball and catch it. More on that later :-)<p>


            <p>So let’s address some burning questions.<p> 

            <h2 class="section-heading">What the heck is a 'Hackathon' & should I attend one?</h2>

            <p>Typical hackathons will ease you into the weekend with a few social ice-breaking activities. Potential favorites are rock-paper-scissors and forming random unrelated words into potential business ideas. For instance ‘sushi shaped marshmallows’! This is a real example of a quick 5-10 minute idea forming into a funny pitch.<p>

            <<p>The key at this point is for you to get out of your comfort zone and feel relaxed in a new creative environment.<p>

            <p>Post ice-breaking activities, participants are encouraged to pitch ideas they wish to work on during the next 48 hours. At this preliminary stage pitches are generally high-level and half-baked around the theme set by the organisers.<p>


            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
