            <p>I recently decided to attend a 48-hour hackathon organised by <a href=”https://t.co/ytyA6c8Wsy”>Founders of the Future</a>. Straight away I received some interesting comments from friends who wanted to understand more. These included questions such as “I didn’t know you’re a hacker?!”. I have to admit stringing them on that one was enjoyable.<p>


            <p>Firstly, let’s dispel some myths; hackathons are not for just for geeks who code or wannabe hackers. Anyone can attend a hackathon, not just software developers. Non-technical skills are just as useful.<p>

            <p>Two things are key to enjoying a hackathon in my opinion. Stay <b>open-minded</b> and have a willingness to learn. If you don't have that, then at least make sure you can bounce a ball and catch it. More on that later :-)<p>


            <p>So let’s address some burning questions.<p> 

            <h2 class="section-heading">What the heck is a 'Hackathon' & should I attend one?</h2>

            <p>Typical hackathons will ease you into the weekend with a few social ice-breaking activities. Potential favorites are rock-paper-scissors and forming random unrelated words into potential business ideas. For instance ‘sushi shaped marshmallows’! This is a real example of a quick 5-10 minute idea forming into a funny pitch.<p>

            <p>The key at this point is for you to get out of your comfort zone and feel relaxed in a new creative environment.<p>

            <p>Post ice-breaking activities, participants are encouraged to pitch ideas they wish to work on during the next 48 hours. At this preliminary stage pitches are generally high-level and half-baked around the theme set by the organisers.<p>


            <blockquote class="blockquote">Idea selection.</blockquote>

            <p>Everyone gets to vote for 2 - 3 ideas each and the ones with the most votes are shortlisted. This is the chance to back the idea(s) that resonate best with you. It is also important that your personality does not clash with anyone on the team. One way to avoid that is by picking as diverse a team as possible, so you can truly bring something different to the table. After all you’ll be spending long hours with these people and be expected to deliver something under a pressing timeframe.<p>

            <p>So ice-breaking is over. Ideas have been shortlisted. You've formed a team. Now the excitement can begin. Bring out those bouncy balls!(*) Especially for those awkward moments.<p> 



            <h2 class="section-heading">Enjoying the Process</h2>

            <p>Whatever you do, just don’t panic! If you fear that you cannot contribute much to the team; breathe. Create a role for yourself, or support someone else in a task. You should recognise the fear and move on. Get ready to learn by doing something you’re not used to doing and are probably not good at. Whether that is building a mobile prototype, identifying a target market for a product or creating a pitch slide deck, everyone has a role.<p> 

            <p>The earlier you get comfortable with these crazy like-minded people the better.<p> 

            <p>(*) Debates and decisons under time pressure can easily get heated. An easy-to-do trick if everyone has an opinon is to use an object such as a squishy ball to represent a microphone. That helps allow everyones opinon to be heard and avoid interuptions.<p>
            
            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
